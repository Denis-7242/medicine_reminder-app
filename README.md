### Important Android Setup Notes

The app requires **Core Library Desugaring** for `flutter_local_notifications` to work properly. This is already configured in the provided `build.gradle` file with:

```groovy
compileOptions {
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}

dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4'
}
```

**Minimum SDK Requirements:**
- minSdk: 21 (Android 5.0)
- compileSdk: 34 (Android 14)
- targetSdk: 34

## 🔧 Configuration

### Android

For Android 13+ (API level 33), notification permissions are automatically requested. The app includes all necessary permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Show notifications
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` - Schedule precise reminders
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Restore reminders after device restart

```

## 📚 Dependencies

- **provider** (^6.1.1) - State management
- **hive** (^2.2.3) - Local NoSQL database
- **hive_flutter** (^1.1.0) - Hive Flutter integration
- **flutter_local_notifications** (^17.1.2) - Local notifications
- **intl** (^0.19.0) - Date/time formatting

## 🎨 Design Features

- Soft teal/pastel color scheme for a calming effect
- Rounded cards and buttons for modern UI
- Responsive layout for phones and tablets
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Color-coded status indicators (Green = Taken, Red = Missed, Orange = Pending)
- Progress tracking with percentage indicators

## 🔔 Notifications

The app uses `flutter_local_notifications` to schedule reminders:
- Notifications are scheduled for exact times
- Persistent across app restarts
- Show medicine name and dosage
- Support for multiple daily reminders per medicine

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored locally using Hive:
- **Medicines**: Stores medicine details and reminder times
- **Logs**: Tracks daily medication intake with timestamps
- No internet connection required
- Fast and efficient local database

## 🚨 Known Limitations

- Currently supports "Daily" frequency (Weekly and As Needed are stored but not fully implemented)
- No cloud backup (all data is local)
- No medicine inventory tracking
- No refill reminders

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Cloud sync with Firebase
- [ ] Medicine inventory management
- [ ] Refill reminders
- [ ] Statistics and insights
- [ ] Export logs to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Multi-user support for caregivers
- [ ] Medication interaction warnings
- [ ] Camera to scan medicine labels
